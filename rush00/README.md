# Retro Space Shooter

Built in 2 days, [Sam](https://github.com/scollet1) and I built a classic arcade space shooter.

#### Getting started
To compile the binary:
```
make
```
If you want to clean up all the files and leave the binary:
```
make clean
```
To delete it all yet keep the source files:
```
make fclean
```

#### Controls
```
[UP][DOWN][LEFT][RIGHT] Move your ship
[SPACE]                 Shoot bullets
[P]                     Pause the game
```

Cheers and enjoy!
